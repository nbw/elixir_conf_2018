# üîë Keynotes

I'm going to just say you should watch them all. They're the keynotes and were all good.

# üÜô Level Up

These are the ones we'd watch to improve your everyday Elixir.

1. [Architecting Flow in Elixir - From Leveraging Pipes to Designing Token APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycpNi701aCs) 

    Founder of Credo. Great talk and breakdown with examples of different code patterns (pipes, with, and tokenization)

1. [Growing Applications and Taming Complexity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ue--hvFzr0o)

    When you've been working on a Phoenix project for a while and it get's complicated. Good speaker. 

1. [A Deep Dive into Hex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbCnTKVLuu8)

    The guy was funny too. That helps.

1. [Picking Properties to Test in Property-Based Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVLTHGaTi7k): 

    Good speaker. Actually made it very interesting with his example.

1. [Elixir At A Walking Pace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IOobarmwQg)

1. Breaking Down the User Monolith
    
    Great breakdown. A talk about how to breakdown your user "schema" into smaller parts so that it doesn't just become a behemoth struct. Not complicated Elixir, but a really implementation of splitting concerns. 

# üí™ Flex talks

These are impressive uses of Elixir, worth checking out if you have the interest or extra time. 

1. [You Can Never Debug the Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4xMarVUZQ4)

    The speaker broke down how IEx.break works by going from Elixir, Erlang, C to Beam byte code (with intelij) and back again

1. [Behavior Trees and Battleship: Tapping into the Power of Advanced Data Structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sLYzxuKGXI)

    It's a hit! Cool talk. Great if you like tree structures (#battlesnake)

1. [Docker and OTP: Friends or Foes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLApFANtkHs)

    Super impressive talk about using docker with OTP (specifically multinode applications). Great breakdown of concepts. Had a live demo. Guy works at Google's Cloud team. Great metaphors too.

1. [Using Elixir GenStage to Track Video Watch Progress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLApFANtkHs)

    Real production implementation of Genstage with code examples. We enjoyed this one. Not crazy complicated either.

# üç¨ Extra Mentions

These ones don't fit in the above categories but were cool.

1. [Did you Hear that Wind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIAbmVrjZS8)

    Matt really liked this one. It's a nerves one!

1. [Erlang/OTP: What's in the Box?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozSfI-Zepw) 

    There's a lot of stuff that isn't wrapped from Erlang that's actually quite useful. Even little helper methods for string. Cool talk from a Plataformatec employee.

1. [Texas; Virital DOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWgwUKfR8Xg)

    None of us saw it, but we want to watch it after seeing Chris's keynote.
